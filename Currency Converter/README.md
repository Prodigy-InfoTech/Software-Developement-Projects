## Currency Converter

This project is a simple web-based currency converter built using HTML, JavaScript, and an external ExchangeRate-API. 
It allows users to select two currencies, enter an amount in one currency, and instantly see the equivalent amount in the other currency.
The exchange rates are fetched in real-time from the ExchangeRate-API and displayed dynamically on the web page. Users can also swap the selected currencies with the click of a button.
It provides a convenient way for users to quickly convert currencies and stay updated with exchange rates.
